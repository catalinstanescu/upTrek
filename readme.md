The code receives 2 numbers width/cols and height/rows and create a white canvas of cols*rows (cels). Set color with 'Color picker' and click on the canvas. The clicked cell will change its color. Another click on the same cell change it back to white. 
The 'Painter' has also the 'drag & draw' ability.
